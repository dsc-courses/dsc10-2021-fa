Alice rolls a 20-sided die, adds a modifier of 11 to the result (because her character is good at knocking down doors), and succeeds in knocking down the door if the total is at least 16.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 1.1.** Write code that simulates this procedure.  Compute three values: the result of Alice's roll (`roll_result`), the result of her roll plus Roga's modifier of 11 (`modified_result`), and a boolean value indicating whether the action succeeded (`action_succeeded`).  **Do not fill in any of the results manually**; the entire simulation should happen in code.\n",

She would separate herself from the practitioner with a board, so they couldn't see her, and she'd ask them to place both hands through an opening in the board. Emily would flip a coin. Depending on how the coin landed, she would place her hands above the practitioner's left hand or the practitioner's right hand. The TT practitioner would then have to detect Emily's HEF and specify whether Emily was hovering above their left hand or their right hand. Overall, in 210 samples, the practitioner picked the correct hand 44% of the time. \n",

TT practitioners hit back and accused Emily and her family of tampering with the results, while some claimed that Emily's bad spiritual mood towards therapeutic touch made it difficult to read her HEF. Whatever it may be, Emily's experiment is a classic example about how anyone, with the right resources, can test anything they want!"

    "Suppose an iPhone manufacturing company claims that it produces iPhone 13s that are 98% non-faulty. In other words, only 2% of the iPhone 13s that they manufacture have some fault in them. They open a retail shop at UCSD's Price Center right before the new school year. Since this new store sells iPhone 13s at a discount for college students, 100 UCSD freshmen bought iPhone 13s at this shop. However, it is soon discovered that six of the students have faulty iPhone 13s and are complaining about the quality of their phone. People are angry and try to argue that the company's claim is wrong. But the company is adamant that they are right. "
