I'm born and raised in San Diego, earned my Bachelors in Statistics from Cal Poly San Luis Obispo and am currently a CSE and Artificial Intelligence Masters student. This is my fourth time TAing for Professor Tiefenbruck, and my second time TAing for DSC 10. DSC 10 is such a fun class to TA for because the projects and assignments are fun and relevant to current events and I love getting to know other students. A random fact about me is I recently became an aunt and I'm a self proclaimed "fun aunt".
