Hi everyone! My name is Dylan (but I also go by Dyl for short), and I'm a third year Data Science major and Cognitive Science minor from Sixth College! This will be my fourth time tutoring for DSC 10, and I'm especially excited since this will be my first time tutoring in-person. I am also a student representative on behalf of the HDSI program here at UCSD, so please don't be afraid to reach out about anything regarding this class in particular, or just the Data Science major in general! A little bit about myself is that I'm originally from Orange County, CA, and outside of class I love skateboarding, shopping, and sports (basketball/tennis)!
