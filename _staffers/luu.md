Hello! I'm a second year Data Science Major in Marshall College! I'm so excited to be your tutor and meet all of you while introducing you to the foundations of Data Science! I'm from San Bernardino, CA and I love to cook, try new foods, and skate! Fun Fact: I can drink a 16 oz water bottle in under a second xD!
