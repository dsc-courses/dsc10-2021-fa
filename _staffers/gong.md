Hi, I'm a sophomore majoring in Math & Statistics. I'm from China, and I went to a high school in Tennessee. It's my first time to be a tutor, and as a tutor, I'm still in a learning process. The reason I applied for DSC10 is that students from different majors would choose it as a beginning coding course, and I'm glad to meet you and help you.
